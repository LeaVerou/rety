## Background & Motivation

I love live coding as a teaching tool, and over the years

It allows the speaker to demonstrate not only the final state of a coding snippet, but how you get there, and what the intermediate results are.

However, it does create a unique challenge: My live coded slides don't make sense without me.
This may be acceptable for a conference talk, which is usually recorded, but not in other contexts,
such as teaching a university course, where all instructors need to be able to teach all lectures.

I didn't want to remove live coding from my slides, as I truly belive it is the perfect implementation of the *"show, not tell"* teaching advice,
so I thought instead: what if I could *record* my live coding, and make it replayable? And thus, rety was born.
